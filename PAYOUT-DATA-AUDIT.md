## üí° Next Steps

1. **Check TradingPilot.net** for payout data on high-priority firms
2. **Check Payout Junction** as alternative source

4. **Update quarterly** - Payout data changes over time
5. **Add disclaimer** - Note that not all firms use blockchain verification

## üìù Notes

- Only add data that can be verified via TradingPilot.net or Payout Junction
- DO NOT estimate or fabricate payout numbers
- Some firms may not use blockchain verification (that's okay)
- Payout data is a premium feature that builds trust
