    <h1>Expert Analysis: Navigating the 2025 Prop Trading Landscape</h1>
    
    <h2>Analysis of 2025 Prop Firm Research & Key Insights</h2>
    <p>The data confirms several overarching trends in the prop firm space as of 2025:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Market Saturation & Specialization:</strong> The sheer number of firms shows a saturated market.
