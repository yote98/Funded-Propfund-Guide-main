### 2. **Goat Funded Trader** ‚ùå DELIST

- ‚õî **Rule clarity issues** - rules changed after funding
- ‚õî **Support responsiveness problems**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple complaints about payout delays

**Industry Sources:** BestPropFirms.com evaluations

**Recommendation:** **REMOVE IMMEDIATELY** - Payout issues are RED FLAGS

---

### 3. **Maven Trading** ‚ö†Ô∏è DELIST
**Current Status in DB:**
- ID: `maven-trading`
- Rating: 4.3 (MISLEADING)
- Review Count: 4,700

**Reasons for Delisting:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Limited data for 2025" (your own cons list)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Verification Status: `unverified` in your DB

**Industry Sources:** BestPropFirms.com

**Recommendation:** **REMOVE** - Low scores + unverified status = liability

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CONTROVERSIAL: Review Carefully

### 4. **Apex Trader Funding** üîç REVIEW CAREFULLY
**Current Status in DB:**
- ID: `apex-trader-funding`
- Rating: 4.7 (HIGH)
- Review Count: 13,000 (LARGE)
- **Featured:** YES

**Conflicting Information:**
- ‚õî **Industry reports:** Scored below 50/100 (BestPropFirms.com)
- ‚õî **Complaints:** Unclear rules, slow support, inconsistent payouts
- ‚úÖ **BUT:** Very popular with 13K reviews
- ‚úÖ **BUT:** Featured on many legitimate sites
- ‚úÖ **BUT:** Verified by TheTrustedProp, TradingPilot

**Analysis:**
This is **CONTROVERSIAL**. Apex is one of the biggest futures firms, but there are concerning reports. The issue may be:
1. They're so large that complaints are more visible
2. They may have had past issues that are now resolved
3. Some competitors may be pushing negative reviews

**Recommendation:** 
- **DO NOT DELIST YET** - Too popular to remove without concrete evidence
- **MONITOR CLOSELY** - Add a note in the cons about "mixed reviews"
- **VERIFY** - Do independent research on recent payout history
- **Consider adding warning:** "Large volume of traders, some report delays"

## üìä Summary & Action Plan

### IMMEDIATE DELISTING (3 firms):
1. ‚ùå **Blue Guardian** - Poor industry scores, breach complaints
2. ‚ùå **Goat Funded Trader** - Withdrawal problems, unclear rules
3. ‚ùå **Maven Trading** - Unverified + poor industry scores

### MONITOR CLOSELY (1 firm):
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Apex Trader Funding** - Conflicting reports, needs investigation

---

## üîç Additional Firms to INVESTIGATE

These firms have low data/reviews and should be monitored:

### Low Review Count (Potential Risk):
- **Funding Ticks** (400 reviews) - NEW 2025 firm, unproven
- **Leeloo Trading** (750 reviews) - "30-day minimum before first payout" red flag
- **Breakout Prop** (450 reviews) - "Limited data", "Unproven track record"
- **Venus Funded** (300 reviews) - Very new, minimal data
- **My Flash Funding** (700 reviews) - "Newer firm with less history"

**Recommendation:** Keep these but add **"‚ö†Ô∏è NEW FIRM"** badges and warnings

---

## üìù Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Remove the 3 Problem Firms
```typescript
// Remove these IDs from mockData.ts:
- 'blue-guardian'
- 'goat-funded-trader'
- 'maven-trading'
```

### Step 2: Update Expert Analysis
Remove mentions of these firms from any educational content or "best firm" lists.

### Step 3: Add Warning System
Create a warning badge system for:
- üÜï **NEW** - Firms with <1 year history
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNVERIFIED** - Firms without third-party verification
- üîç **MIXED REVIEWS** - Firms with concerning reports but large user base

### Step 4: Update Apex (if keeping)
Add to cons:
```typescript
cons: [
  "Large volume means some payout delays reported",
  "Mixed reviews from some traders",
  "Support can be slow during peak times"
]
```
