## ‚è≠Ô∏è **DECISION TIME:**

**Which option do you prefer?**

1. **Skip Batch 2** - Current state is good enough
2. **Option A** - You'll provide logos, I'll add them
3. **Option B** - I'll find logos, you approve
4. **Option C** - Focus on top firms only

**OR**

5. **Move to Batch 3** - Optimize existing logos only

## üí° **MY RECOMMENDATION:**

**Skip to Batch 3** (optimize existing) because:
- Current logos are working well
- Fallback badges look professional
- Focus on what we have
- Saves time

**Then later**, if needed, we can add specific logos one by one.
